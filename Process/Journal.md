## Shmup Game - Quack Attack: Citrus Siege

Designing the shmup was way harder then I imagined espically with only a week to create the game I needed something simple but different. I went with a Duck and decided to make the enemies Lemonade stand guys a reference to a classic childrens video growing up.

The process of making the game was pretty smooth except for two bugs that were quite diffult to fix:

The first bug was the players bullets destroying the player, the bug actually happened because there was a rogue ! in one of the if statements... Two hours of crying later...

The second bug was player to enemie collisions, this ended up being fixed after the first bug.

I don't consider this game finished as of yet, but I did learn a lot about Unity and C#. In the future I would have liked to add powers ups, and infinite mode and some sounds, but unfortuantely for someone who has never touched Unity before this was incredily difficult and took a lot of time just making the core aspects.

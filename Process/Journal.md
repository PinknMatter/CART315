## Shmup Game - Quack Attack: Citrus Siege

Designing the shmup was way harder then I imagined espically with only a week to create the game I needed something simple but different. I went with a Duck and decided to make the enemies Lemonade stand guys a reference to a classic childrens video growing up.

The process of making the game was pretty smooth except for two bugs that were quite diffult to fix:

The first bug was the players bullets destroying the player, the bug actually happened because there was a rogue ! in one of the if statements... Two hours of crying later...

The second bug was player to enemie collisions, this ended up being fixed after the first bug.

I don't consider this game finished as of yet, but I did learn a lot about Unity and C#. In the future I would have liked to add powers ups, and infinite mode and some sounds, but unfortuantely for someone who has never touched Unity before this was incredily difficult and took a lot of time just making the core aspects.

# Week 8 Starting the Interactive Prototype

We decided to remove the "RPG" Battle component since it would disrupt the overall flow of the game as well as we are on a time limit.

My role within the game is designing the HUD and GameManagement Systems. I'm to design how the meters work and how they effect the overall happiness as well as the Event Log, Player Count and Time.

We first started by designing the art to get it out of the way first, we went for a top-down pixel art to pay homage to pokemon.
